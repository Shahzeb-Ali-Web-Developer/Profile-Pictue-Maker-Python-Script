This script can help you to turn a simple picture into a professional Profile Picture to be used on any social platfrom like
Linkedin, Whatsapp or FaceBook.

Download all the files and place them in a folder. Extract the onyl zip file named "To be extracted in same folder" and Put in the picture you want to edit in the same folder, make sure its in
JPG format and is square shaped. Then rename the picture to "input.jpg" (a sample would be already there for u).

After this, open the Run.py file in some code editor (I made this on PyCharm) and make sure you've all packages installed which are used init.

Hit Run and it'll generate the picture for you.

Note: If you see error "Insuficient Credit", go to www.remove.bg and get API key by creating a free account. Replace that API key in Run.py file using some code editor, in 9th Line.
